          About the size of a matchstick, the implant provides protection
          from pregnancy for five years. Although, you will have to go to
          the doctor to have it injected into your arm. </p>

          <h1>The IUD (Non-hormonal/Hormonal)</h1>
          <br><p>
          The current intrauterine devices (IUD) are small devices, often ‘T’
          -shaped, often containing either copper or levonorgestrel, which are
          inserted into the uterus. They are one form of long-acting reversible
          contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth
          control.</p>

          <h1>The Shot (Hormonal)</h1>
          <br><p>
          An injection given by a medical professional of the hormone progestin
          in the arm or hip that lasts three months and prevents pregnancy 99%
          of the time. Less than 1 out of 100 women will get pregnant each year
          if they always use the shot as directed. The shot, also known as
          Depo-Provera, stops the ovaries from releasing eggs and thickens the
          cervical mucus, so it is difficult for sperm to enter the uterus.  </p>

          <br><p>
          A flexible ring that is inserted into the vagina each month for three
          weeks at a time that prevents pregnancy 99% of the time. Less than 1
          out of 100 women will get pregnant each year if they always use the
          ring as directed. The vaginal ring releases hormones that stop the
          ovaries from releasing eggs and thickens cervical mucus, so it is

          The patch is applied (like a sticker) weekly anywhere on the skin
          (except for the breasts) and prevents pregnancy 99% of the time. Less
          than 1 out of 100 women will get pregnant each year if they always use
          the patch as directed. The patch releases hormones that stop the
          ovaries from releasing eggs, and it thickens cervical mucus, so it is

          <br><p>
          A pill that should be taken at the same time every day for maximum
          effectiveness, which is often used to reduce cramping and bleeding
          during periods and that prevents pregnancy 99% of the time. Less than
          1 out of 100 women will get pregnant each year if they take the pill
          each day as directed. The pill releases hormones (progestin-only or a
          combination of hormones) to stop the ovaries from releasing eggs and
          thickens cervical mucus, so it is difficult for sperm to enter the
          uterus. </p>

          A diaphragm is a form of birth control that’s a shallow cup shaped

          The birth control sponge (aka the contraceptive sponge or “the sponge”
          for short), is a small, round sponge made from soft, squishy plastic.
          You put it deep inside your vagina before sex. The sponge covers your
          cervix and contains spermicide to help prevent pregnancy. Each sponge
          has a fabric loop attached to it to make it easier to take out.</p>

          <br><p>
          The cervical cap (FemCap) is a soft, thimble-shaped cup made out of
          silicone or latex. It fits snugly over the cervix (where the uterus
          opens into the vagina). It's designed to block sperm from reaching the
          woman's egg. That's why it's called a “barrier” method of birth
          control.</p>

          <br><p>
          Made with sperm-killing chemicals, spermicides such as foams,
          suppositories or film (used separately, not in combination) prevent
          pregnancy 82% of the time. 18 out of 100 women will get pregnant each
          year if they always use the spermicide as directed. Placed inside the
          vagina shortly before sex, spermicides block the cervix and keep sperm
          from joining with an egg. </p>

          Natural family planning involves a woman tracking her monthly cycle
          from her period through ovulation to determine when she is most and
          least likely to get pregnant. When used correctly, this method
          prevents pregnancy 76% of the time. 24 out of 100 women who use
          natural family planning will have a pregnancy if they use the method

          Withdrawal prevents pregnancy 73% of the time by pulling the penis out
          of the vagina before ejaculation. 27 out of 100 women whose partners
          use withdrawal will become pregnant each year, even if used correctly.
          Remember, there is always a chance of pregnancy if sperm is introduced

            If you’re breastfeeding, you can safely use hormonal methods.
            They won’t hurt you or your baby. You can start using the shot,
            implant, Skyla and Mirena IUDs, and some types of birth control
            pills (called mini-pills) right after giving birth. You may be able
            to get an implant or IUD in the hospital or at your postpartum
            checkup. Implants and IUDs are super effective, and prevent
            pregnancy for several years.</p>

          <h1>Abstinence/Outercourse</h1>
          <br><p>
            The definition of abstinence is when you don’t have sex. Outercourse
            is other sexual activities besides vaginal sex. Using outercourse as
            birth control means you do some sexual activities, but you don’t
            have vaginal sex or get any semen in the vagina. This way, the sperm
            cells in semen can’t get to an egg and cause pregnancy. Some
            outercourse examples include kissing, massage, masturbating, dry
            humping (grinding), and talking about your fantasies. People may
            also choose to have oral sex and/or anal sex. But both anal and oral
            sex can spread STDs, so use a condom during oral sex and anal sex.

          Sterilization is a procedure that closes or blocks your fallopian
          tubes so you can’t get pregnant. (Your tubes are where eggs and sperm
          meet. Women can choose from bilateral tubal ligation in the hospital

          center.</p>

          <h1>Vasectomy</h1>
          <br><p>
            Vasectomy is minor surgery to block sperm from reaching the semen
            that is ejaculated from the penis. Semen still exists, but it has no
            sperm in it. After a vasectomy the testes still make sperm, but they
            are soaked up by the body. Each year, more than 500,000 men in the
            U.S. choose vasectomy for birth control.</p>
